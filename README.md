# The Starship Depot

The Starship Depot is a fully featured e-commerce website, with user accounts, secure credit card payments, a database of products, and tracking for carts and order history. Users can add items to their cart and checkout whether they're logged in or not, and have their carts persist between visits and through logins. Order history is only tracked for logged-in users, however. 

## The Starship Depot is still in progess

The development team is planning to make the presentation and styling a bit slicker with Materialize, expand the testing suites, hunt down the last bugs, refactor whatever can be done more cleanly, and do a final round of neatening on the code.

We may also expand our product line to other scifi franchises.

## Alas, The StarShip Depot is both fully functional and fully fictional

As of yet, we cannot actually get you a Death Star for less than the price of a car.
